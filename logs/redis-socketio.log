2122:M 16 Nov 07:01:05.373 # You requested maxclients of 10000 requiring at least 10032 max file descriptors.
2122:M 16 Nov 07:01:05.374 # Server can't set maximum open files to 10032 because of OS error: Operation not permitted.
2122:M 16 Nov 07:01:05.374 # Current maximum open files is 4096. maxclients has been reduced to 4064 to compensate for low ulimit. If you need higher maxclients increase 'ulimit -n'.

2122:M 16 Nov 07:01:05.651 # WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under low memory condition. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
2122:M 16 Nov 07:01:05.651 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
